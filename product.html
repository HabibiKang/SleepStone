The Ultimate Weighted Blanket for a Cozy and Restful Sleep.

SleepStone is designed to provide deep pressure stimulation that mimics the feeling of a warm hug, helping you to feel relaxed and calm. With weight options ranging from 3 to 45 pounds and sizes ranging from 36" by 38" all the way up to 88" by 104", SleepStone is suitable for people of all ages and sizes.

Our blankets are made from high-quality materials that are both soft and durable. The blanket's outer layer is made from a luxurious, breathable fabric that feels great against your skin. The inner layer is filled with hypoallergenic, non-toxic, and odorless glass beads that are evenly distributed to ensure maximum comfort and effectiveness.

SleepStone is perfect for people who have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. It's also great for people who experience anxiety or stress and are looking for a natural way to relax. Our blanket is easy to use - simply lay it over your body when you're ready to sleep, and let the weight work its magic.

SleepStone is also easy to care for. Simply toss it in the washing machine and dryer for quick and easy cleaning. Our blankets are built to last, so you can enjoy the benefits of SleepStone for years to come.
